# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2022 ðŸŽ„

My [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) solutions to the
[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) puzzles.

## Running the puzzles

The repository is a [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo) workspace with
a separate binary target for each day. Input files (sample and actual) are in
the `input` directory of each member crate.

```bash
# In directory AoC2022/day-NN:
$ cargo run --release < input/input.txt
```
